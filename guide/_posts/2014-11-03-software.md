## The Interface

The interface for the robot allows you to control it remotely from any computer over a wireless network.
The interface will allow you to see and hear what the robot sees and hears as well as to control the robot
by giving it instructions.

Before you can control the robot you have to install the software on the robot's computer.
If you havenâ€™t already done so, you should download the latest version of the code from the robot's
repository on GitHub at [github.com/gunthercox/salvius](https://github.com/gunthercox/salvius).
