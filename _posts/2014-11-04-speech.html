title: Speech and Speech Synthesis Options for Robotics
---

<big>
    Language can become a barrier for humans and robots when trying to communicate.
    The robot will have the ability to produce sounds in order to communicate with people,
    animals and other robots.

### Options for speech

When I first started exploring ways to add speech to my robotics projects
I was using a small FM transmitter to send audio to the robot. However, it can probably be agreed that just sticking a radio in the robot isn't that cool. Instead we are going to look at a few of the different software and hardware required make this conversion.

### Operational requirements

- Can't slow down other processes to generate the audio.
- Ability to stop speaking process on demand.
- Ability to queue tasks for processing.
- Ability to modify pronunciations as needed.

### Options

Text to speech can be done through the hardware **or** software level.

## Design goal

We are going to set up a dedicated speech processor that will receive text data from the robot's main computer which it will then process into audio signals that can be understood as words.

### Arduino for speech synthesis

- Lowest cost
- Lowest quality audio output

Many programs to do this have already been created so all you have to do is load it onto the Arduino board.

### Raspberry Pi for speech synthesis

***

An amplifier will be required in either case to amplify the audio you generate for output through speakers.
