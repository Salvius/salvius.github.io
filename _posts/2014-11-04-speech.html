<h2>Exploring Speech and Speech Synthesis for Robotics</h2>
<hr/>

<big>
    Language can become a barrier for humans and robots when trying to communicate.
    The robot will have the ability to produce sounds in order to communicate with people,
    animals and other robots.

<h3>Options for speech</h3>
<p>
    When I first started exploring ways to add speech to my robotics projects
    I was using a small FM transmitter to send audio to the robot. However, it can probably be agreed that just sticking a radio in the robot isn't that cool. Instead we are going to look at a few of the different software and hardware required make this conversion.
</p>

<h3>Operational theory</h3>
<p>
    Can't slow down other processes to generate the audio.
    Ability to stop speaking process on demand.
    Ability to queue tasks for processing?
    Ability to modify pronunciations as needed.

    We are going to set up a dedicated speech processor that will receive text data from the robot's main computer which it will then process into audio signals that can be understood as words.

<h3>Arduino for speech synthesis</h3>
<p>
    Lowest cost
    Lowest quality audio output
    The program to do this has already been created so all you have to do is load it onto the Arduino board.

    <h3>Raspberry Pi for speech synthesis</h3>

    <hr/>

    An amplifier will be required in either case to amplify the audio you generate for output throug speakers. Next see the amplifier project -->
