            <h2>About the LM386N-1</h2>
            <strong>How Integrated Circuit Pins are numbered:</strong>
            <p>http://blog.salvius.org/2012/06/ics-integrated-circuits.html</p>
            <p>
            ICs will almost always have an indicator in the form of a small tab shape, circle or both on one side of the body to indicate the left side of the chip. With the pins facing down (live bug) and the indicator mark to the left you can count the pins. The pins start at 1 on the bottom left and count up as you go the the right. Then the top row starts counting on the right and goes to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
            To build this amplifier we are using the LM386N-1 Audio Amplifier IC. This is a pretty usefull chip because it has low voltage requirements and an excellent amount of amplification. A good way to learn about this chip is to check out the data sheet which is available if you just do a search for "LM386N-1 datasheet" and you should find that there is plenty available from different manufacturers.
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm using the Texas Instruments version of this sheet and they provide some useful hints down near the bottom of the sheet. They say:
            If a capacitor is put from pin 1 to 8, bypassing the 1.35 k&#8486; resistor, the gain will go up to 200 (46 dB).
            </p>
            <p>
            So this is pretty useful because this tells us how we can increase the gain for this amplifier. The gain is just the amount that our amplifier increases the sound signal. By default LM386 chip has a gain of 20 but were going to increase that because we want to get as much out of this chip as we can.

            Building the amplifier on a breadboard before soldering it together makes it easier to test for problems if it turns out that we made a mistake while building it.

            This is a tool you can make to test the breadboard. Use a cable from a pair of headphones and connect both pairs of ground and signal wires together as shown. Usually you can find a friend who has a broken pair to donate.

            <h2>Testing the breadboard circuit</h2>
            <p>
            Connect the battery and plug in a radio or mp3 play to test your breadboard circuit. You should hear it working, if not go back and check to make sure that everything is connected correctly. If you have double checked your work and it is still not working it is possible that one of the ICs is not working. If that is the case, try switching it out with a new one.

            The next thing we are going to do is solder the parts
            onto a circuit board to make it permanent.
            </p>
            <p>
            For this step I am going to also use a IC socket so
            that I can easily replace the ICs if I ever need to.

    This PCB board comes with a perforated line down the center where you could probably snap the two pieces apart. A miter saw can be used to sever the thatching between the halves resulting in a cleaner edge. Use a block of wood to elevate the PCB board while you cut it.
