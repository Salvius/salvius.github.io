n is even           n = 2k

direct:

if n<sup>2</sup> + 8 is even, then n is even.
n<sup>2</sup> is even               if n is odd, then n<sup>2</sup> + 8 is odd
n<sup>2</sup> = 2k                  n is odd

15 = 3 * 5
> 3 is a factor if 15
> 3 is a divisor of 15
> 15 is a multiple of 3
> 15 is divisible by 3

**Definition:** For integers a and b with b != 0, we say
that b divides a if a = bc for some integer c. We write b|a
> 3 divides 15 because 15 = 3 * 5                       3|15
> 5 | 15
> 2 /| 15 (char needs to be replaced with a bar with a slash through it)

All of these statements mean the same thing:
> b is a divisor of a  
> b is a factor of a  
> a is a multiple of b  
> a is divisiable by b  

> -3 divides 15 since 15 = (-3)(-5)
> 4|0                  0 = 4 * 0
> 7|0
> 12|0
> -42|0

not allowed:
0|0
because: 0 = 0 * x where x is not unique.

Example:
Find all positive divisors of 12.
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

> 1 * 12 = 12
> 2 * 6 = 12
> 3 * 4 = 12

**Definition of a prime**
1. A prime is any **non-zero** **positive** **integer** that is **only** divisible by 1 and itself.
2. A integer is prime if its only positive divisors are 1 and itself.
3. **An integer p is prime if it has exactly two different positive divisors.**
4. An integer n > 1 is prime if and only if for all positive integers r and s, if n = rs, then r = 1 or s = 1.

**Primes**
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17...

**Definition of a composit**
1. An integer n > 1 is composit if it is not prime.
2. An integer n is composit if there exist integers a and b with 1 < a < n and 1 < b < n such that n = ab.
3. There exit positive integers r and s such that n = rs and r != 1 and s != 1.

Is 5377 prime?
2 /| 5377
3 /| 3577    5 + 3 + 7 + 7 = 22   3 /| 22
5 /| 5377
7 /| 5377    7 root(5377)
root(5377) is roughly equal to 73

```
boolean isPrime(int n) {

    if (n <= 1) {
        // Fail fast if n is zero or negative
        return false;
    }

    for (int d = 2; d <= (int)Math.sqrt(n); d++) {
        if (n % d == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Result:** For all n > 1, if n is **not** divisible by any positive integer
that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to sqrt(n), then n is prime.

**Proof:** (by contrapositive)
Let n > 1 be an integer. Assume n is composite. Then there exist
integers r and s with 1 < r < n and 1 < s < n such that n = rs.
Furthermore it is imposible for both r > sqrt(n) and s > sqrt(n) for
otherwise n = rs > sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. So either 1 < r <= sqrt(n) or
1 < s <= sqrt(n)> Thus n **is** divisible by a positive integer that is
greater than 1 and less than of equal to sqrt(n).
