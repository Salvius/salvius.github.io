Def For integers a and b with b ≠ 0,
we say that b divides a, written b|a
if and only if a = b * c for some integer c.

> 2|10 because 10 = 2 * 5 and 5 ∈ ℤ.  
> 4∤22 because 22 != 4 * c for any integer c there is no integer c such that 22 = 4c.

## Properties of Divisibility
- **Transative** For integers a, b, c, if a|b and b|c, then a|c.
> **Proof:** Let a, b, c, be integers.  
> Assume a|b and b|c.  
> So b = a * c for some integer x and  
> c = b * y for some integer y.  
> Thus c = a * x * y = a(xy). Since x and y are integers  
> we know xy is an integer.  
> Thus a|c.

## Divisibility Test
> 6|n   <=>   2|n and 3|n  
> ab|c  <=    a|c and b|c  
> *Notice:* The use of the *Walker Property* in this example.
> **Result:** For integers a, b, c, if  
> a|c and b|c, then ab|c.  
> **Proof:** Let a, b, c be integers.  
> Assume a|b anf b|c.  
> Then c = ax and c = by for some integers x and y.  
> *At this point we see that there was a problem in prooving this.*  
> **Counterexample:** a = 2   b = 4   c = 12  
> 2|12   and   4|14  
> 2 * 4 = 8   and   8∤12.  

> **Result:** (Anti-Walker Property)  
> For integers a, b, c, if ab|c, then a|c and b|c.  
> **Proof:** Let a, b, c, be integers.  
> Assume ab|c. Then c = ab*x for some integer x.  
> Thus c = a(bx) and we know bx ∈ ℤ. So a|c.  
> Also c = b * (ax) and we know ax ∈ ℤ.  
> Thus b|c.  

- **True or False (proove or disproove)**
1. If a|b and a|c, then a|bc.
2. If a|bc, then a|b and a|c.
3. If a|bc, then a|b or a|c.
4. If a|b and b|d, then ac|bd.
5. If a|b and c|d, then a+c|b+d.
